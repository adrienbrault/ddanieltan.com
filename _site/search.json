    "text": "Quarto\nOne reason why I got tempted to start a blog again is Quarto! Quarto is the shiny, new publishing framework (from RStudioPosit) that I use to publish this blog. Quarto is reminiscent of Rmarkdown, but rebuilt around the pandoc engine. Quarto feels purpose built for the entire data community, supporting all the major Data Science languages (Python, R, Julia, Javascript), and supporting a wide spectrum of output formats (pdf reports, websites, presentations and more).\nYou can see my unbridled enthusiasm after first learning about Quarto here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶along with my ‚Äúthis-is-a-huge-moment-in-history‚Äù hyperbole\n\n\nJumpstarting this blog\nThese were the best resources I found online to help me jump start this blog.\n\n1. Official Quarto Documentation (website and repos)\nThe official docs are extensive and well-written. Specific to building a blog, I frequently find myself on the website page, publishing page or thumbing through their gallery for inspiration.\n\n\n2. Danielle Navarro‚Äôs ‚ÄúPorting a Distill Blog to Quarto‚Äù (blog and repo)\nDanielle‚Äôs blog post is the perfect starting template. I found her recommended YAML settings, blog theme and deployment instructions very sensible and well-suited for a blog.\n\n\n3. The small but growing collection of Quarto content online\nAt the time of writing, I did not find a large collection of Quarto-specific content online. Nevertheless, I did find some helpful gems from Youtube videos, Github discussions or websites that had a helpful tip or two that I could use for my blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{tan2022,\n  author = {Daniel Tan},\n  title = {Hello World},\n  date = {2022-07-15},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDaniel Tan. 2022. ‚ÄúHello World.‚Äù July 15, 2022."
