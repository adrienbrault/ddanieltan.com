It helps me to organise my thoughts, maximise my impact and reflect on my learnings. Yet, I have consistently not prioritised writing and it is a disservice to myself that I have not made set aside time for deliberate practice.\nI have started and abandoned more blogs than I can remember, so I always start a new blogging project with some apprehension. But, as mentioned above, writing is too important for me to not try again.\nHereâ€™s to another shot at this. Wish me luck!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy visualisation of Hello world + Quarto logo"

Just following this alone will get you started with a perfectly beautiful and functional blog. \nHowever, your blog is also your personal slice out on the internet, and if you can add just a tad bit of your personality into the content, it makes it more enjoyable for your readers. Here are my favourite tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile it is fun to add these bells and whistles, do not lose focus on the most important part of your blog - the content."

You have permission to not write, but you donâ€™t have permission to do anything else.\n\n\nI would go down to my lovely little gazebo at the bottom of the garden, sit down, and Iâ€™m absolutely allowed not to do anything. Iâ€™m allowed to sit at my desk, Iâ€™m allowed to stare out at the world, Iâ€™m allowed to do anything I like, as long as it isnâ€™t anything. Not allowed to do a crossword, not allowed to read a book, not allowed to phone a friend, not allowed to make a clay model of something. All Iâ€™m allowed to do is absolutely nothing, or write.\n\nFor a couple of years now, I have adapted a version of this exercise to help me complete my learning projects. Every year I make the grand announcement that this will be the year of X. Where X is a learning topic or a new programming language that I wish to focus on.\n\n\nI declared this my year of Scala all the way back in Jan, but I only started this blog in July, which is why this post is published in September ðŸ˜….\n\n\n\nðŸŽ‰ 2022 year is my year of Scala! ðŸŽ‰\n\n\nInspired by Neilâ€™s rules, my rules for this year are:\n\nFor every project that requires coding, I am going to try and use Scala\nBut, I give myself permission to not use Scala if it is just not the right option for my use case\nHowever, I do not have permission to try out any other shiny new programming language I might be tempted by"

As I hop in and out of these separate computing systems, it gets pretty difficult to synchronise all my config files, settings, scripts and shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDallE2 art with prompt: â€˜Keeping things organized across multiple machines, digital artâ€™\n\n\n\n\nAs this is a common problem that plagues many programmers, it is unsurprising that there is a clever piece of software written to solve this problem - Stow. Stow is a symlink manager that when coupled with any version control software (ie. git) can create a simple and effective config sync system. I have used such a system for the last couple of months and is something I can no longer live without.\n\n\nWhen youâ€™ve written the same code 3 times, write a functionWhen youâ€™ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post\n\nâ€” David Robinson (@drob) November 9, 2017\n\n\nI find myself bringing up Stow pretty often in conversations so I wanted to take @drobâ€™s advice. However, as there are many excellent blogs that already do a great job explaining what Stow is, I think I canâ€™t add much value to that conversation. Instead, Iâ€™m going to shift my energy toward creating a straightforward how-to recipe."
