# Welcome to my blog
I started this blog to have a place on the internet where I can practice and publish my writing. 
Writing has been a very remarkable part of my professional and personal life. So really, it is a disservice to myself that I have not made the deliberate effort to set aside time to practice writing. 

I have started and abandoned more blogs than I can remember, so I always start a new blogging project with some apprehension. But, as mentioned above, writing is too important for me to not try again.

Here's to another shot at this. Wish me luck!
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Hello to a new world with Quarto logo overlaid"
knitr::include_graphics("quartoWorld.png")
```

# Quarto
One reason why I got tempted to start a blog again is [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)! Quarto is the shiny, new publishing framework (from ~~RStudio~~[Posit](https://posit.co/)) that I use to publish this blog. Quarto is reminiscent of Rmarkdown, but rebuilt around the pandoc engine. Quarto allows you to write technical content in either Python, R or Julia, and have that content flexibly published as a pdf report, website or presentation. My first couple of hours playing with Quarto was a real treat!

You can see my unbridled enthusiasm here.

# Jumpstarting this blog
These were the best resources I found online to help me jump start this blog.

#### 1. Official Quarto Documentation ([website](https://quarto.org/) and [repos](https://github.com/quarto-dev))
The official docs are extensive and well-written. Specific to building a blog, I frequently find myself on the [website page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), [publishing page](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) or thumbing through their [gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) for inspiration. 

#### 2. Danielle Navarro's “Porting a Distill Blog to Quarto” ([blog](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/) and [repo](https://github.com/djnavarro/quarto-blog))
Danielle's blog post is the perfect starting template. I found her recommended YAML settings, blog theme and deployment instructions very sensible and well-suited for a blog.

#### 3. The small but growing collection of Quarto content online
At the time of writing, we do not have a large collection Quarto-specific content online. Nevertheless, you can still find some helpful gems from [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=quarto+blog), [Github discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions) or [websites](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/) that had a helpful tip or two that I could use for my blog.
