So really, it is a disservice to myself that I have not made the deliberate effort to set aside time to practice writing. \n\nI have started and abandoned more blogs than I can remember, so I always start a new blogging project with some apprehension. But, as mentioned above, writing is too important for me to not try again.\n\nHere's to another shot at this. Wish me luck!\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Hello to a new world with Quarto logo overlaid](quartoWorld.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Quarto\nOne reason why I got tempted to start a blog again is [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)! Quarto is the shiny, new publishing framework (from ~~RStudio~~[Posit](https://posit.co/)) that I use to publish this blog. Quarto is reminiscent of Rmarkdown, but rebuilt around the pandoc engine and promises to be programming language agnostic. My first couple of hours playing with Quarto was a real treat, and I appreciated the vision of having a single framework where a Data Scientist could use any language to publish content in any format.\n\nYou can see my unbridled enthusiasm here.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6943566445809152000\" height=\"726\" width=\"504\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Embedded post\"></iframe>\n</p>\n\n:::{.column-margin}\n...along with my \"this-is-a-huge-moment-in-history\" hyperbole \n:::\n\n# Jumpstarting this blog\nThese were the best resources I found online to help me jump start this blog.\n\n#### 1. Official Quarto Documentation ([website](https://quarto.org/) and [repos](https://github.com/quarto-dev))\nThe official docs are extensive and well-written. Specific to building a blog, I frequently find myself on the [website page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), [publishing page](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) and thumbing through their [gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) for inspiration. \n\n#### 2. Danielle Navarro's “Porting a Distill Blog to Quarto” ([blog](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/) and [repo](https://github.com/djnavarro/quarto-blog))\nDanielle's blog post is the perfect starting template. I found her recommended YAML settings, blog theme and deployment instructions very sensible and well-suited for a blog.\n\n#### 3. The small but growing collection of Quarto content online\nAt the time of writing, we do not have a large collection Quarto-specific content online. Nevertheless, you can still find some helpful gems from [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=quarto+blog), [Github discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions) or [websites](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/) that had a helpful tip or two that I could use for my blog.\n",
